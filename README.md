# How to install.

## I have added chatGPT to the script!!! If you would like to use it run: wsl nano +179 main.py

This script is sadly for windows only. Working on getting it cross platform.

Please download and run __[install.bat](http://github.com//Tytan-Codes/Better-Day/releases/download/0.0.1/install.bat)__ to install requirments and the script its self.


If you prefer to install manualy ↓↓↓


```
git clone https://github.com/tysudo/better_day-0.0.1.git
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
winget install sl
py main.py
```

- [x] Added at least 12 working functions
- [x] Add easer CLI
- [ ] Make crossplatform 
- [ ] Add UI
