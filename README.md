# How to install.

### I have added chatGPT to the script! If you would like to use it run: __wsl nano +179 main.py__ You must put your openAI API key where it says "YOUR openAI API KEY HERE"
### Must have winget installed for script to work.
This script is sadly for windows only. Working on getting it cross platform. 

Please download and run __[install.bat](http://github.com//Tytan-Codes/Better-Day/releases/download/0.0.1/install.bat)__ to install requirments and the script its self.


If you prefer to install manualy ↓↓↓


```
winget install sl
winget install GNU.nano
wsl --install
git clone http://github.com/Tytan-Codes/Better-Day.git
cd better_day
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
py main.py
```

- [x] Added at least 12 working functions
