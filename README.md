# How to install.
#### MUST HAVE WINGET INSTALLED FOR install.py TO WORK
I have added chatGPT to the script! If you would like to use it run: __wsl nano +179 main.py__ <br />
You must put your openAI API key where it says "YOUR openAI API KEY HERE" <br />
You API key can be found __[here](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys)__. <br />
This script is sadly for windows only. Working on getting it cross platform.  <br />


To install the script you must run __install.py [(click to download)](https://0jwg1-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/tytan_thetytan_com/EUqPtzc4noBAstK5B6BR-3sBQZ13fCMmNX9Ylh8XM9Ikzw?e=ofNxMC)__


If you would like to install manualy ↓↓↓


```
winget install sl
winget install GNU.nano
wsl --install
git clone http://github.com/Tytan-Codes/Better-Day.git
cd better_day
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
py main.py
```
<br/>
<br/>

You do not need python AT ALL wth this method

Install EASY WAY (Its easy but you have to run the command evertime you want to run the script.)

RUN EVERYTIME YOU WANT TO RUN THE SCRIPT
```
cd WereverYouDownloadedTheScript
Better_Day\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

You are now in VENV to use the script run:
```
py main.py
```
