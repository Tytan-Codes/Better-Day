# How to install.
#### MUST HAVE WINGET INSTALLED FOR install.py TO WORK
I have added chatGPT to the script! If you would like to use it run: __wsl nano +179 main.py__ <br />
You must put your openAI API key where it says "YOUR openAI API KEY HERE" <br />
You API key can be found __[here](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys)__. <br />
This script is sadly for windows only. Working on getting it cross platform.  <br />


To install the script you must run __install.py [(click to download)](https://0jwg1-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/tytan_thetytan_com/EUqPtzc4noBAstK5B6BR-3sBQZ13fCMmNX9Ylh8XM9Ikzw?e=ofNxMC)__
