# Better Day

## How to install:

### Notice: This branch is ***Unstable*** this means you may get bugs that will break the script, make sure you run update.py ***daily*** to make sure you are on the latest stuff. 

### Update the script by running:

```
python3 (or py) update.py
```

You must be singed in to git and gh. Look up how to do it if you want the script to work. I don't keep any of those credentials. Git needs them for the update.
### Linux / Windows install:

```
git clone -b Unstable https://github.com/tytan-codes/better-day.git
cd better-day
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
