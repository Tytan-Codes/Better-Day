# How to install.

#### MUST HAVE WINGET INSTALLED FOR INSTALL.BAT TO WORK
I have added chatGPT to the script! If you would like to use it run: __wsl nano +179 main.py__ <br />
You must put your openAI API key where it says "YOUR openAI API KEY HERE" <br />
You API key can be found __[here](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys)__. <br />
This script is sadly for windows only. Working on getting it cross platform.  <br />

Please download and run __[install.bat](http://github.com//Tytan-Codes/Better-Day/releases/download/0.0.1/install.bat)__ to install requirments and the script its self.


If you prefer to install manualy ↓↓↓


```
winget install sl
winget install GNU.nano
wsl --install
git clone http://github.com/Tytan-Codes/Better-Day.git
cd better_day
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
py main.py
```
